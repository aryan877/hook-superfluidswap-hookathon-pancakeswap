# SuperFluidSwapper: Dynamic Fee Adjustment Hook

SuperFluidSwapper is an innovative DeFi project that implements a Dynamic Fee Adjustment Hook, leveraging Brevis Network's ZK coprocessor and PancakeSwap's v4 hooks to create a sophisticated, data-driven fee adjustment mechanism for liquidity pools.

## Project Overview

SuperFluidSwapper aims to revolutionize liquidity provision by dynamically adjusting transaction fees based on real-time market conditions and historical data analysis. Our goal is to optimize liquidity provider returns, minimize impermanent loss, and create a more efficient and responsive DeFi ecosystem.

## Key Features

1. Real-time fee adjustment based on market conditions
2. Historical data analysis for trend identification
3. Impermanent loss mitigation strategies
4. Zero-knowledge proofs for transparency and security
5. Seamless integration with PancakeSwap v4
6. Adaptive liquidity distribution

## Project Structure

SuperFluidSwapper consists of two main repositories:

1. [SuperFluidSwapper Contracts](https://github.com/aryan877/hookathon-contracts)
2. [SuperFluidSwapper Brevis Integration](https://github.com/aryan877/hookathon-brevis)

### SuperFluidSwapper Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for the SuperFluidSwapper project, including the PancakeSwap v4 hooks and custom logic for dynamic fee adjustment.

#### Key Components

- DynamicFeeAdjustmentHook.sol: Core contract implementing the fee adjustment logic
- Historical data tracking for volumes, volatilities, liquidities, and impermanent losses
- Integration with Brevis for ZK proof verification

### SuperFluidSwapper Brevis Integration

This repository houses the off-chain components and ZK circuit implementations for SuperFluidSwapper.

#### Key Components

- circuit.go: ZK circuit implementation for fee adjustment proofs
- index.ts: Off-chain script for fetching data, generating proofs, and updating fees

## Getting Started
